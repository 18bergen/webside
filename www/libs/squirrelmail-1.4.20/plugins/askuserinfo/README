Ask User Info Plugin, version 1.0

| NOTE: SquirrelMail 1.5.2 and up already support this functionality
| and do not need this plugin!
*

This plugin pushes users a little bit more to enter their personal info.
When a user logs in and doesn't have full name/email set, it directs
the user to the relevant options page.

Optionally you can remove or add checks for more personal info.

If you want to use this plugin, you might also consider the
retrieveuserdata plugin to fill in this info automatically in stead
of prompting the user.

Requirements: SquirrelMail 1.4.0 or higher, up to 1.5.1.

Feedback appreciated.
